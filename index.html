     <h3>Prayer</h3>
    Prayer must come with faith. Jesus curse a tree but the deciples never believed what he did.When they were on their way or passing by,they saw the fig tree dried up. Peter said "Rabbi"look. The fig tree which you coursed has withered away. Jesus said,HAVE FAITH IN GOD.
    <p>Prayer moves mountains, prayer heals, destroies, build, open doors, close doors, strengthen etc. After all this,what can make it work is by believing what you have said. 23, says"For assuredly, i say to you, whoever says to this mountains, be removed and be cast into the sea; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. </p>
    <ol>Hanna prayed and believed (1 samuel 1:10-13)</ol>
    <ol>Jesus christ prayed and he saw what is going to happened(Matt 26:36-46)</ol>
